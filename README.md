Hello, I made this project for fun.

Just use docker please the src is fine to use as well but you need golang, bun, garble and openssl.

To use docker copy the docker-compose.yml to your working directory and run

```sh
docker compose up
```

to update run

```sh
docker compose pull
```

It's literally just docker any question chatgpt can answer so don't worry.
